# team-profile-gen

## Description

This Node.js command-line application takes in information of employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person!

When the application is started, you'll be prompted to enter a name, employee ID, email and office number for the team manager. Then be presented with the option to add an enginner or an intern to build your team.

You'll be prompted to enter a name, ID, email, and GitHub username for each engineer. For each intern, you'll be prompted to enter a name, ID, email, and school. Once the team build is finished, an HTML is generated displaying your team!
